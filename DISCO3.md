## abstract


> [abstract]: 
> we present an engineering focused aesthetic for a novel design framework: disco. disco's is a web3 focused UI/UX framework that is built to enable, provide and reinforce *trust* in the underlying process (both the activity and the application they are using itself). By communicating to the end user directly and indirectly we hope to significatly reduce user error prone mistakes 


## motivation

User interface development tools are very powerful. They can be used to construct large and complex user interfaces, with only a relatively small amount of code written by an application developer. And yet, despite the power of such tools and the relatively small amount of code that is written, user interface software often has the following characteristics:

-   the code can be difficult to understand and review thoroughly:
-   the code can be difficult to test in a systematic and thorough way;
-   the code can contain bugs even after extensive testing and bug fixing;
-   the code can be difficult to enhance without introducing unwanted side-effects;
-   the quality of the code tends to deteriorate as enhancements are made to it.

Despite the obvious problems associated with user interface development, **little effort has been made to improve the situation**. Any practitioner who has worked on large user interface projects will be familiar with many of the above characteristics, which are **symptomatic of the way in which the software is constructed**.


### Principles for Transactions

[UX/UI] Manage transaction wait time. Clarify blockchain specific times and manage userâ€™s wait in various phases and feedback. <br>
[UX/UI] Within the context of an individual, adapt to progressively increase/decrease the amount of new lingo and specific concepts that they need to learn and are exposed to. never combine expert-level blockchain-specific lingo with the need-to-know basics when acting within the same context of an individual; create tiers of knowledge levels. You can show an expert the basics, but never the other way around. <br>
[UX/UI] Use a consistent visual language to dictate addresses. use human-readable deterministic visual representation of the hash (i.e. Identicons, Blockies et al.) when possible. allow users to expand the full address/hash and copy. <br>
[UX/UI] Apply relevance to interrupting messages only for information relevant to the current user. <br>
[UX/UI] Clarify which data comes from the blockchain and which doesnâ€™t. <br>
[UX/UI] Types of transactions i.e. value transfers, function calls, contract generating. <br>
[UX/UI] When a blockchain event aborts or otherwise fails to complete as expected, the fallback must remain functional with resulting blockchain state clear. <br>
[UX/UI] Allow users to subscribe-to, unsubscribe-from or temporarily mute certain events. <br>
[UX/UI] Errors MUST populate back to the user.
[UX/UI] Budget performance and response time so that stallouts or failovers can be approximated in worse-case


#### Example: Bad UI/UX can cost big

## UI/X - Design Decision Records


## Colors - Semantic Aliases

A guide to providing semantic aliases for colors.

Referencing color scales by their actual scale name can work well, like `blue` and `red`.
But often, creating semantic aliases like `accent`, `primary`, `neutral`, or `brand` can be helpful, especially when it comes to theming.


#### Bad Color Aliasing

```css
@import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/blue.css';
@import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/green.css';
@import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/yellow.css';
@import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/red.css';

:root {
  --accent1: var(--blue1);
  --accent2: var(--blue2);
  --accent3: var(--blue3);
  --accent4: var(--blue4);
  --accent5: var(--blue5);
  --accent6: var(--blue6);
  --accent7: var(--blue7);
  --accent8: var(--blue8);
  --accent9: var(--blue9);
  --accent10: var(--blue10);
  --accent11: var(--blue11);
  --accent12: var(--blue12);

  --success1: var(--green1);
  --success2: var(--green2);
  /* repeat for all steps */

  --warning1: var(--yellow1);
  --warning2: var(--yellow2);
  /* repeat for all steps */

  --danger1: var(--red1);
  --danger2: var(--red2);
  /* repeat for all steps */
}
```

## Why Color Alias Matters

With this approach, you will likely run into issues where you need to use the same scale for multiple semantics. Common examples include:

-   If you map `yellow` to "**warning**", you might also need `yellow` to communicate "**pending**".
    
-   If you map `red` to "danger", you might also need `red` to communicate "error" or "rejected".
    
-   If you map `green` to "success", you might also need `green` to communicate "valid".
    
-   If you map `blue` to "accent", you might also need `blue` to communicate "info".
    

> ðŸ’¡ In this scenario, you can choose to define multiple semantic aliases which map to the same scale.

#### Good Color Alias 

```css
@import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/blue.css';
@import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/green.css';
@import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/yellow.css';

:root {
  --accent1: var(--blue1);
  --accent2: var(--blue2);
  --info1: var(--blue1);
  --info2: var(--blue2);

  --success1: var(--green1);
  --success2: var(--green2);
  --valid1: var(--green1);
  --valid2: var(--green2);

  --warning1: var(--yellow1);
  --warning2: var(--yellow2);
  --pending1: var(--yellow1);
  --pending2: var(--yellow2);
}

```


<!-- 
```ts
import { createCss } from '@stitches/react';
import {
  blue,
  green,
  yellow,
  red
} from '@radix-ui/colors';
const { styled } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
...blue,
...green,
...yellow,
      accent1: '$blue1',
      accent2: '$blue2',
      info1: '$blue1',
      info2: '$blue2',
      success1: '$green1',
      success2: '$green2',
      valid1: '$green1',
      valid2: '$green2',
      warning1: '$yellow1',
      warning2: '$yellow2',
      pending1: '$yellow1',
      pending2: '$yellow2',
},
},
});
```
-->

## Choosing semantic color cales

For most projects, you will need colors to communicate semantic meaning. Here are some common pairings that work well in Western culture.


- Error: Red/Tomato/Crimson

- Success: Teal/Green/Grass/Mint

- Warning: Yellow/Amber

- Info: Blue/Sky/Cyan

In many cases, you might eventually need most of the scales, for one reason or another. Your app may support multiplayer mode, where you assign a color to each user. Your app may have a labelling feature, where your users assign a color to a task. Your app may use badges to communicate "pending" or "rejected" states.



### Structure

#### Feature folders

**Don't** _just_ have a folder named `components` and throw everything in there.

**Do** have a folder named `features` where each sub-folder is a specific feature containing all the files related to that feature.

 Use feature folders to identify boundaries in your system.
 
 ### [The principle](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation#the-principle)

**The concept of co-location can be boiled down to this fundamental principle:**

Place code as close to where it's relevant as possible

You might also say: "Things that change together should be located as close as reasonable." ([Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)


### Testing
-   **Integration**: Verify that several units work together in harmony.
-   **Unit**: Verify that individual, isolated parts work as expected.
-   **Static**: Catch typos and type errors as you write the code.

### Heuristics

# Antipatterns

Most of those are antipatterns in the Python programming language, but
some of them might be more generic.

## Strict email validation

It is almost impossible to strictly validate an email. Even if you were
writing or using a regex that follows
[RFC5322](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4), you would
have false positives when trying to validate actual emails that don't
follow the RFC.

What's more, validating an email provides very weak guarantees. A
stronger, more meaningful validation would be to send an email and
validate that the user received it.

To sum up, don't waste your time trying to validate an email if you
don't need to (or just check that there's a `@` in it). If you need to,
send an email with a token and validate that the user received it.

## Late returns

Returning early reduces cognitive overhead, and improve readability by
killing indentation levels.

Bad:

```python
def toast(bread):
    if bread.kind != 'brioche':
        if not bread.is_stale:
            toaster.toast(bread)
```

Good:

```python
def toast(bread):
    if bread.kind == 'brioche' or bread.is_stale:
        return

    toaster.toast(bread)
```

## Hacks comment

Bad:

```python
# Gigantic hack (written by Louis de Funes) 04-01-2015
toaster.restart()
```

There's multiple things wrong with this comment:

- Even if it is actually a hack, no need to say it in a comment. It
  lowers the perceived quality of a codebase and impacts developer
  motivation.
- Putting the author and the date is totally useless when using source
  control (`git blame`).
- This does not explain why it's temporary.
- It's impossible to easily grep for temporary fixes.
- [Louis de FunÃ¨s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Fun%C3%A8s)
  would never write a hack.

Good:

```python
# Need to restart toaster to prevent burning bread
# TODO: replace with proper fix
toaster.restart()
```

- This clearly explains the nature of the temporary fix.
- Using `TODO` is an ubiquitous pattern that allows easy grepping and
  plays nice with most text editors.
- The perceived quality of this temporary fix is much higher.

## Repeating arguments in function name

Bad:

```python
def get_by_color(color):
    return Toasters.filter_by(color=color)
```

Putting the argument name in both the function name and in arguments is,
in most cases and for most interpreted languages, redundant.

Good:

```python
def get(color=None):
    if color:
        return Toasters.filter_by(color=color)
```

## Repeating class name in method name

Bad:

```python
class Toasters(object):
    def get_toaster(self, toaster_id):
        pass
```

This is bad because it's unnecessarily redundant
(`Toasters.get_toaster(1)`). According to the single responsibility
principle, a class should focus on one area of responsibility. So the
`Toasters` class should only focus on toasters object.

Good:

```python
class Toasters(object):
    def get(self, toaster_id):
        pass
```

Which produces much more concise code:

```
toaster = Toasters.get(1)
```

## Repeating function name in docstring

Bad:

```python
def test_return_true_if_toast_is_valid():
    """Verify that we return true if toast is valid."""
    assert is_valid(Toast('brioche')) is true
```

Why is it bad?

- The docstring and function name are not DRY.
- There's no actual explanation of what valid means.

Good:

```python
def test_valid_toast():
    """Verify that 'brioche' are valid toasts."""
    assert is_valid(Toast('brioche')) is true
```

Or, another variation:

```python
def test_brioche_are_valid_toast():
    assert is_valid(Toast('brioche')) is true
```

## Unreadable response construction

TODO

Bad:

```python
def get_data():
    returned = {}
    if stuff:
        returned['toaster'] = 'toaster'
    if other_stuff:
        if the_other_stuff:
            returned['toast'] = 'brioche'
    else:
        returned['toast'] = 'bread'
    return returned
```

Good:

```python
def get_data():
    returned = {
        'toaster': '',
        'toast': '',
    }
```

## Undeterministic tests

When testing function that don't behave deterministically, it can be
tempting to run them multiple time and average their results.

Bad:

```python
def function():
    if random.random() > .4:
        return True
    else:
        return False


def test_function():
    number_of_true = 0
    for _ in xrange(1000):
        returned = function()
        if returned:
            number_of_true += 1

    assert 30 < number_of_true < 50
```

There are multiple things that are wrong with this approach:

- This is a flaky test. Theoretically, this test could still fail.
- This example is simple enough, but `function` might be doing some
  computationally expensive task, which would make this test severely
  inefficient.
- The test is quite difficult to understand.

Good:

```python
@mock.patch('random.random')
def test_function(mock_random):
    mock_random.return_value = 0.7
    assert function() is True
```

This is a deterministic test that clearly tells what's going on.

## Unbalanced boilerplate

One thing to strive for in libraries is have as little boilerplate as
possible, but not less.

Not enough boilerplate: you'll spend hours trying to understand specific
behaviors that are too magical/implicit. You will need flexibility and
you won't be able to get it. Boilerplate is useful insofar as it
increases
[transparency](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html).

Too much boilerplate: users of your library will be stuck using outdated
patterns. Users will write library to generate the boilerplate required
by your library.

I think Flask and SQLAlchemy do a very good job at keeping this under
control.

## Inconsistent use of verbs in functions

Bad:

```python
def get_toasters(color):
    """Get a bunch of toasters."""
    return filter(lambda toaster: toaster.color == color, TOASTERS)


def find_toaster(id_):
    """Return a single toaster."""
    toasters = filter(lambda toaster: toaster.id == id_, TOASTERS)
    assert len(toasters) == 1
    return toasters[1]


def find_toasts(color):
    """Find a bunch of toasts."""
    return filter(lambda toast: toast.color == color, TOASTS)
```

The use of verb is inconsistent in this example. `get` is used to return
a possibly empty list of toasters, and `find` is used to return a single
toaster (or raise an exception) in the second function or a possibly
empty list of toasts in the third function.

This is based on personal taste but I have the following rule:

- `get` prefixes function that return at most one object (they either
  return none or raise an exception depending on the cases)
- `find` prefixes function that return a possibly empty list (or
  iterable) of objects.

Good:

```python
def find_toasters(color):
    """Find a bunch of toasters."""
    return filter(lambda toaster: toaster.color == color, TOASTERS)


def get_toaster(id_):
    """Return a single toaster."""
    toasters = filter(lambda toaster: toaster.id == id_, TOASTERS)
    assert len(toasters) == 1
    return toasters[1]


def find_toasts(color):
    """Find a bunch of toasts."""
    return filter(lambda toast: toast.color == color, TOASTS)
```

## Opaque function arguments

A few variants of what I consider code that is difficult to debug:

```python
def create(toaster_params):
    name = toaster_params['name']
    color = toaster_params.get('color', 'red')


class Toaster(object):

    def __init__(self, params):
        self.name = params['name']


# Probably the worst of all
def create2(*args, **kwargs):
    name = kwargs['name']
```

Why is this bad?

- It's really easy to make a mistake, especially in interpreted
  languages such as Python. For instance, if I call
  `create({'name': 'hello', 'ccolor': 'blue'})`, I won't get any error,
  but the color won't be the one I expect.
- It increases cognitive load, as I have to understand where the object
  is coming from to introspect its content.
- It makes the job of static analyzer harder or impossible.

Granted, this pattern is sometimes required (for instance when the
number of params is too large, or when dealing with pure data).

A better way is to be explicit:

```python
def create(name, color='red'):
    pass  # ...
```

## Hiding formatting

Bad:

```python
# main.py

from utils import format_query


def get_user(user_id):
    url = get_url(user_id)
    return requests.get(url)


# utils.py


def get_url(user_id):
    return 'http://127.0.0.1/users/%s' % user_id
```

I consider this an antipattern because it hides the request formatting
from the developer, making it more complex to see what `url` look like.
In this extreme example, the formatting function is a one-liner which
sounds a bit overkill for a function.

Good:

```python
def get_user(user_id):
    url = 'http://127.0.0.1/users/%s' % user_id
    return requests.get(url)
```

Even if you were duplicating the logic once or twice it might still be
fine, because:

- You're unlikely to re-use anywhere else outside this file.
- Putting this inline makes it easier for follow the flow. Code is
  written to be read primarily by computers.

## Returning nothing instead of raising NotFound exception

Bad in certain cases:

```python
def get_toaster(toaster_id):
    try:
        return do_get_toaster(toaster_id)
    except NotFound:
        return None


def toast(toaster_id):
    toaster = get_toaster(toaster_id)
    ...
    toaster.toast("brioche")
```

It all depends on the caller, but in this cases I'd argue that it is bad
practice to return nothing when the toaster identified by `toaster_id`
can't be found, for two main reasons.

**First reason**: when we provide an identifier, we expect it to return
something. Once again, this depends on the caller (for instance, we
could try to see if a user exists by checking an email for instance). In
this simple example it's ok because the `toaster.toast()` will fail
immediately, but what if we were never calling it and creating some
other unrelated objects? We would be doing things that we should never
be doing if the object did not exist:

```python
def toast(toaster_id, user):
    toaster = get_toaster(toaster_id)
    # We should never do this! The toaster might not even exists.
    send_welcome_email(user)
    bill_new_toaster(user)
```

**Second reason**: `toaster.toast` will fail anyway if `toaster` is none
(in Python with `AttributeError: NoneType has no attribute toast`). In
this abstract example it's ok because the two lines are next to each
other, but the actual `toaster.toast()` call might happen further down
the stack - and it will be very difficult for the developer to
understand where the error is coming from.

```python
def toast(toaster_id, user):
    toaster = get_toaster(toaster_id)
    do_stuff_a(toaster)


def do_stuff_a(toaster):
    ...
    do_stuff_b(toaster)
    ...


def do_stuff_b(toaster):
    # Here is the actual call where toaster is called - but we should
    # have failed early if it's not there.
    toaster.toast()
```

What's the correct things to do?

- If you expect the object to be there, make sure to raise if you don't
  find it.
- If you're using SQLAlchemy, use `one()` to force raising an exception
  if the object can't be found. Don't use `first` or `one_or_none()`.

## Having a library that contains all utils

Bad:

```python
def get_current_date():
    ...


def create_csv(...):
    ...


def upload_to_sftp(...):
    ...
```

`util` or `tools` or `lib` modules that contain all sorts of utilities
have a tendency to become bloated and unmaintainable. Prefer to have
small, dedicated files.

This will keep your imports logical (`lib.date_utils`, `lib.csv_utils`,
`lib.sftp`), make it easier for the reader to identify all the utilities
around a specific topic, and test files easy to keep organized.

dragonball = 'z';

// good
const items = getItems();
const goSportsTeam = true;
const dragonball = 'z';
```

#### comma-dangle

> 20.2 Additional trailing comma: Yup. eslint: 

    Why? This leads to cleaner git diffs. Also, transpilers like Babel will remove the additional trailing comma in the transpiled code which means you donâ€™t have to worry about the trailing comma problem in legacy browsers.

```diff
// bad - git diff without trailing comma
const hero = {
     firstName: 'Florence',
-    lastName: 'Nightingale'
+    lastName: 'Nightingale',
+    inventorOf: ['coxcomb chart', 'modern nursing']
};

// good - git diff with trailing comma
const hero = {
     firstName: 'Florence',
     lastName: 'Nightingale',
+    inventorOf: ['coxcomb chart', 'modern nursing'],
};
```

#### implicit-arrow-linebreak

Enforce the location of arrow function bodies with implicit returns. eslint: 

```js
// bad
(foo) => bar;

(foo) => bar;

// good
(foo) => bar;
(foo) => bar;
(foo) => bar;
```


## Naming Convention

We recommend using camel case, pascal case or snake case for your theme tokens. Other word separators may not work as expected.

```js
// recommended
tokenName
token_name
token-name

// avoid
token.name
token$name
token*name
```

## Naming Components

  - **Extensions**: Use `.jsx` extension for React components. eslint: [`react/jsx-filename-extension`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-filename-extension.md)
  - **Filename**: Use PascalCase for filenames. E.g., `ReservationCard.jsx`.
  - **Reference Naming**: Use PascalCase for React components and camelCase for their instances. eslint: [`react/jsx-pascal-case`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-pascal-case.md)

```jsx
    // bad
    import reservationCard from './ReservationCard';

    // good
    import ReservationCard from './ReservationCard';

    // bad
    const ReservationItem = <ReservationCard />;

    // good
    const reservationItem = <ReservationCard />;
 ```

- **Component Naming**: Use the filename as the component name. For example, `ReservationCard.jsx` should have a reference name of `ReservationCard`. However, for root components of a directory, use `index.jsx` as the filename and use the directory name as the component name:

```jsx
    // bad
    import Footer from './Footer/Footer';

    // bad
    import Footer from './Footer/index';

    // good
    import Footer from './Footer';
```


## Class vs `React.createClass` vs stateless

  - If you have internal state and/or refs, prefer `class extends React.Component` over `React.createClass`. eslint: [`react/prefer-es6-class`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/prefer-es6-class.md) [`react/prefer-stateless-function`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/prefer-stateless-function.md)

```jsx
    // bad
    const Listing = React.createClass({
      // ...
      render() {
        return <div>{this.state.hello}</div>;
      }
    });

    // good
    class Listing extends React.Component {
      // ...
      render() {
        return <div>{this.state.hello}</div>;
      }
    }
```

> And if you donâ€™t have state or refs, prefer normal functions (not arrow functions) over classes:

```jsx
    // bad
    class Listing extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.hello}</div>;
      }
    }

    // bad (relying on function name inference is discouraged)
    const Listing = ({ hello }) => (
      <div>{hello}</div>
    );

    // good
    function Listing({ hello }) {
      return <div>{hello}</div>;
    }
```

## Names

1.  Use PascalCase for type names.
2.  Do not use "I" as a prefix for interface names.
3.  Use PascalCase for enum values.
4.  Use camelCase for function names.
5.  Use camelCase for property names and local variables.
6.  Do not use "\_" as a prefix for private properties.
7.  Use whole words in names when possible.
8.  Use `isXXXing` or `hasXXXXed` for variables representing states of things (e.g. `isLoading`, `hasCompletedOnboarding`).
9.  Give folders/files/components/functions unique names.

## Exports

1.  Only use named exports. The only exceptions are a tool requires default exports (e.g `React.lazy()`, Gatsby and Next.js `pages`, `typography.js`)

## Components

1.  1 file per logical component (e.g. parser, scanner, emitter, checker).
2.  If not kept in a separate folder, files with ".generated.\*" suffix are auto-generated, do not hand-edit them.
3.  Tests should be kept in the same directory with ".test.\*" suffix
4.  Filename should match the component name. Interfaces for React components should be called `<ComponentName>Props` and `<ComponentName>State`. The only exception is when writing a render prop. In this situation, you, the author, should call the interface for your component's props `<ComponentName>Config` and then the render prop interface `<ComponentName>Props` so it is easy for everyone else to use.

## Types

1.  Do not export types/functions unless you need to share it across multiple components.
2.  Do not introduce new types/values to the global namespace.
3.  Shared types should be defined in 'types.ts'.
4.  Within a file, type definitions should come first (after the imports).

## `null` and `undefined`

1.  Use **undefined**. Do not use `null`. EVER. If null is used (like in legacy Redux code), it should be kept isolated from other code with selectors.

## General Assumptions

1.  Consider objects like Nodes, Symbols, etc. as immutable outside the component that created them. Do not change them.
2.  Consider arrays as immutable by default after creation.

## Flags

1.  More than 2 related Boolean properties on a type should be turned into a flag.

## Comments

1.  Use JSDoc style comments for functions, interfaces, enums, and classes.
2.  **Document crazy stuff.** Always add `@see <url>` and the current date when referencing external resources, blog posts, tweets, snippets, gists, issues etc.
3.  Make note conditions upon which hacks and smelly code can be removed.

## Strings

1.  Use single quotes for strings. Double quotes around JSX string props.
2.  All strings visible to the user need to be localized (make an entry in diagnosticMessages.json).

## When to use `any`

1.  If something takes you longer than 10 minutes to type or you feel the need to read through TS Advanced Types docs, you should take a step back and ask for help, or use `any`.
2.  Custom typings of 3rd-party modules should be added to a `.d.ts` file in a `typings` directory. Document the date and version of the module you are typing at the top of the file.
3.  Consider rewriting tiny modules in typescript if types are too hard to think through.

## Diagnostic Messages

1.  Use a period at the end of a sentence.
2.  Use indefinite articles for indefinite entities.
3.  Definite entities should be named (this is for a variable name, type name, etc..).
4.  When stating a rule, the subject should be in the singular (e.g. "An external module cannot..." instead of "External modules cannot...").
5.  Use present tense.
6.  Use active voice.

## General Constructs

For a variety of reasons, we avoid certain constructs, and use some of our own. Among them:

1.  Do not use `for..in` statements; instead, use `ts.forEach`, `ts.forEachKey` and `ts.forEachValue`. Be aware of their slightly different semantics.
2.  Try to use `ts.forEach`, `ts.map`, and `ts.filter` instead of loops when it is not strongly inconvenient.

## Style

0.  Use prettier and tslint/eslint.
1.  Use arrow functions over anonymous function expressions.
1.  Only surround arrow function parameters when necessary. <br />For example, `(x) => x + x` is wrong but the following are correct:
    1.  `x => x + x`
    2.  `(x,y) => x + y`
    3.  `<T>(x: T, y: T) => x === y`
1.  Always surround loop and conditional bodies with curly braces. Statements on the same line are allowed to omit braces.
1.  Open curly braces always go on the same line as whatever necessitates them.
1.  Parenthesized constructs should have no surrounding whitespace. <br />A single space follows commas, colons, and semicolons in those constructs. For example:
    1.  `for (var i = 0, n = str.length; i < 10; i++) { }`
    2.  `if (x < 10) { }`
    3.  `function f(x: number, y: string): void { }`
1.  Use a single declaration per variable statement <br />(i.e. use `var x = 1; var y = 2;` over `var x = 1, y = 2;`).
1.  Use 2 spaces per indentation.


## Reference Specification

### System UI

> [System UI Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com]


The theme object is intended to be a general purpose format for storing design system style values, scales, and/or design tokens.
The object itself is not coupled to any particular library's implementation and can be used
in places where sharing common style values in multiple parts of a code base is desirable.

#### Scale Objects

Many CSS style properties accept open-ended values like lengths, colors, and font names.
In order to create a consistent styling system, the theme object is centered around the idea of scales,
such as a typographic (font-size) scale, a spacing scale for margin and padding, and a color object.
These scales can be defined in multiple ways depending on needs, but tend to use arrays for ordinal values like font sizes,
or plain objects for named values like colors, with the option of nesting objects for more complex systems.

```js
// example fontSizes scale as an array
fontSizes: [
  12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32
]
```

```js
// example colors object
colors: {
  blue: '#07c',
  green: '#0fa',
}
```

```js
// example nested colors object
colors: {
  blue: '#07c',
  blues: [
    '#004170',
    '#006fbe',
    '#2d8fd5',
    '#5aa7de',
  ]
}
```

#### Scale Aliases

For typically ordinal values like font sizes that are stored in arrays, it can be helpful to create aliases by adding named properties to the object.

```js
// example fontSizes aliases
fontSizes: [
  12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32
]
// aliases
fontSizes.body = fontSizes[2]
fontSizes.display = fontSizes[5]
```

#### Excluded Values

Some CSS properties accept only a small, finite number of valid CSS values and should *not* be included as a scale object.
For example, the `text-align` property accepts the following values:
`left`, `right`, `center`, `justify`, `justify-all`, `start`, `end`, or `match-parent`.
Other properties that are intentionally excluded from this specification include: `float`, `clear`, `display`, `overflow`, `position`, `vertical-align`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, and `flex-direction`.

### Keys

The keys in the theme object should typically correspond with the CSS properties they are used for, and follow a plural naming convention.
For example, the CSS property `font-size` is expected to use values from the `fontSizes` scale, and the `color` property uses values from the `colors` scale.

Some keys can be used for multiple CSS properties, where the data type is the same.
The `color` object is intended to be used with any property that accepts a CSS color value, such as `background-color` or `border-color`.


#### Space

The `space` key is a specially-named scale intended for use with margin, padding, and other layout-related CSS properties.
A space scale can be defined as either a plain object or an array, but by convention an array is preferred.
This is an intentional constraint that makes it difficult to add *"one-off"* or *"in-between"* sizes that could lead to unwanted and rippling affects to layout.

> Note: other names under consideration include *spacing*, *spaces*, and *lengths*.

When defining space scales as an array, it is conventional to use the value `0` as the first value so that `space[0] === 0`.

```js
// example space scale
space: [
  0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
]
```

```js
// example space scale object
space: {
  small: 4,
  medium: 8,
  large: 16,
}
```

```js
// example space scale with aliases
space: [
  0, 4, 8, 16, 32
]
space.small = space[1]
space.medium = space[2]
space.large = space[3]
```

### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are CSS lengths intended for use in media queries.
Commonly, the breakpoints scale is used to create mobile-first responsive media queries based on array values.

#### Media Queries

For convenience and for use with other styling approaches, a `mediaQueries` scale derived from the `breakpoints` scale can be added to the theme object.

```js
breakpoints: [ '40em', '52em', '64em' ]

mediaQueries: {
  small: `@media screen and (min-width: ${breakpoints[0]})`,
  medium: `@media screen and (min-width: ${breakpoints[1]})`,
  large: `@media screen and (min-width: ${breakpoints[2]})`,
}
```
